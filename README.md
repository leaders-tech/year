# Template PWA

This is a teaching template for school projects. It has a frontend (the part users see in a browser) and a backend (the server that stores data).

**What is inside:**

- **Frontend** — React app with TypeScript, built with Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend** — Python web server using aiohttp, stores data in a SQLite file.
- **Tests** — automated checks that verify the app works correctly.

---

## Words you will see in this guide

| Word | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **terminal** | A text window where you type commands. On Mac it is called Terminal, on Windows it is called Command Prompt or PowerShell. |
| **git** | A tool that downloads and tracks code. Every command starts with `git`. |
| **npm** | Node Package Manager — downloads JavaScript libraries that the frontend needs. |
| **uv** | A tool that downloads Python libraries that the backend needs. |
| **make** | A shortcut tool. `make setup` is just a shorter way to run several commands at once. |
| **uv run** | Runs a Python command inside the project's own Python environment. |
| **localhost** | Your own computer. `http://localhost:5101` means "open port 5101 on my own machine". |

## Before you start — check your tools

Do this once on a new machine before cloning anything.

### Check uv (Python package manager)

```bash
uv -V
```

If you get "command not found", install it:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then install a fresh Python:

```bash
uv python install 3.14
```

### Check npm (JavaScript package manager)

```bash
npm -v
```

If you get "command not found", install Node.js via nvm:

```bash
# Install nvm:
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.4/install.sh | bash
# Load nvm without restarting the terminal:
. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
# Install Node.js:
nvm install 24
```

---

## First-time setup

Do this once when you first clone the project.

### Step 1 — Download the project

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leaders-tech/templatePWA.git templatePWA
cd templatePWA
```

`git clone` copies the project to your computer. `cd templatePWA` moves into that folder.

### Step 2 — Install everything

The easiest way (one command does it all):

```bash
make setup
```

That is it. `make setup` installs Python libraries, installs JavaScript libraries, installs browser drivers for tests, and creates the local config files `.env` and `.docker.env`.

<summary>What does make setup do exactly? (click to expand)</summary>

If you are curious, it runs these steps one by one:

```bash
uv sync --all-groups       # installs Python libraries
cd frontend
npm install                # installs JavaScript libraries
npx playwright install     # installs browsers for end-to-end tests
cp .env.example .env
cp .docker.env.example .docker.env
```

You do not need to run these yourself — `make setup` does it for you.
</details>

## Running the app in development

All local app settings live in the root `.env` file.
Change ports, hosts, local secrets, LAN settings, and local e2e settings there.
Do not edit the `Makefile` or frontend config files for that.

You need **two terminals** open at the same time — one for the backend, one for the frontend.

### Terminal 1 — start the backend (Python server)

```bash
make back
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:3101`.

> **With auto-reload:** `make back` already watches for file changes. If you want to run it without auto-reload, use `uv run python -m backend.main`.

### Terminal 2 — start the frontend (React app)

```bash
make front
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5101`.

Open `http://localhost:5101` in your browser to see the app.

### Share the app on the same Wi-Fi

If you want to test the app from another phone, tablet, or laptop on the same Wi-Fi, use the LAN commands instead of the normal localhost commands.

In one terminal:

```bash
make back-lan
```

In another terminal:

```bash
make front-lan
```

To open the correct Wi-Fi URL on this Mac:

```bash
make open-lan
```

In LAN mode, the app uses these ports:

- frontend: `http://<wifi-ip>:5104`
- backend: `http://<wifi-ip>:3104`

Important notes:

- Open the real Wi-Fi IP, not `0.0.0.0`.
- This helper is for macOS and expects the Wi-Fi interface to be `en0`.
- If the Wi-Fi IP cannot be found, use the normal localhost commands instead.
- Use this only on a trusted local network. The dev demo users can be reached from other devices on that Wi-Fi.

### Default login credentials (development only)

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
| user     | user     |
| admin    | admin    |

These accounts exist only in development mode. They are not in production.

---

## How the frontend talks to the backend

`make front` reads the backend URL from the root `.env` file and passes it to Vite automatically.

> **Important:** Use the root `.env` file as the single source of truth for local ports and local URLs. Do not switch to editing `frontend/.env.*`, `Makefile`, or Playwright config files.

In LAN mode, use the same Wi-Fi IP on both sides:

- frontend URL: `http://<wifi-ip>:5104`
- backend URL: `http://<wifi-ip>:3104`

---

## Adding a new library

### Python library (for the backend)

```bash
uv add package-name
```

For a library only used in development (like a testing tool):

```bash
uv add --dev package-name
```

### JavaScript library (for the frontend)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install package-name
```

For a library only used in development:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install -D package-name
```

> Do not edit the dependency files by hand. Use these commands instead — they also update the lock files automatically.

---

## Running tests

### Backend tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Frontend unit tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### End-to-end tests (browser automation)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright opens a real browser, clicks through the app, and checks that everything works.

### Run all tests at once

From the project root:

```bash
make test
```

---

## Formatting code

Formatting makes code look consistent (correct indentation, spacing, etc.).

Python:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run format
```

Or both at once:

```bash
make format
```

---

## Useful make shortcuts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `make setup` | First-time install of everything |
| `make back` | Start backend with auto-reload |
| `make back-once` | Start backend without auto-reload |
| `make front` | Start frontend dev server |
| `make open` | Open the app in the browser |
| `make format` | Format all code |
| `make test` | Run all tests |
| `make test-e2e-docker` | Run browser tests against Docker containers |

---

## Updating dependencies

Safe update (stays within the same major versions — recommended):

```bash
make deps-update-safe
```

After updating, always run tests to make sure nothing broke:

```bash
make test
make test-e2e-docker
```

---

## Docker (optional, for deployment)

Docker packages the app into containers so it runs the same way everywhere.
You do not need Docker for local development. Use it when you want to test the production-style container setup or deploy to `tlfpaas`.

All Docker and Dokploy settings live in the root `.docker.env` file.
Change Docker ports, Docker URLs, Docker secrets, Docker project names, and Docker e2e settings there.
Do not edit `docker-compose.yml` or the Dockerfiles for normal student configuration.

Quick local browser test with Docker:

```bash
make front-docker
make open-docker
```

Open in browser:
- App: `http://localhost:5105`
- Health check through the local gateway: `http://localhost:5105/api/health`

`make front-docker` starts a small local gateway so the browser uses the same path-based contract as production:

- `/api/*` -> backend
- `/ws` -> backend
- everything else -> frontend

If you want only the backend container running for debugging, you can still use:

```bash
make back-docker
```

Stop and remove containers:

```bash
make stop-docker
make clean-docker
```

Run browser e2e tests against the Docker stack:

```bash
make test-e2e-docker
```

## Security notes (for learning)

- Passwords are stored as Argon2 hashes — not as plain text.
- Login uses `HttpOnly` cookies so JavaScript cannot read them.
- `SameSite=Lax` cookies protect against most cross-site request attacks.
- In production, the frontend should be served by nginx or Traefik behind a reverse proxy.

---

## Production deployment

This template is designed for [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/) with Docker Compose.
The root `.docker.env.example` file shows the same variable set that Dokploy should provide.
Set these values in Dokploy instead of editing `docker-compose.yml`:

| Variable | What it is |
|----------|------------|
| `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` | Docker Compose project name for the normal app stack |
| `COOKIE_SECRET` | Secret key for signing cookies — use a long random string |
| `DB_PATH` | SQLite path inside the backend container |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` | Public URL of the app, e.g. `https://myapp.example.com` |
| `VITE_BACKEND_URL` | Frontend API base path for the built app; keep it at `/api` |
| `APP_MODE` | `prod` for production, `dev` to enable demo accounts |

Important notes:

- The frontend API base path is still a build-time value. If `VITE_BACKEND_URL` changes, rebuild the frontend image.
- Internal container ports stay fixed at `8080` and `8081`.
- For this template, keep `VITE_BACKEND_URL=/api` in both local Docker testing and production.
- The base `docker-compose.yml` is intentionally platform-safe for `tlfpaas`: it uses `expose`, route labels, and no local-only port publishing.

### Start the Docker stack

With `.docker.env` filled in, this is enough to boot the stack:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .docker.env -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

That starts the frontend and backend containers. It does not add public one-domain routing by itself.

For local same-origin browser testing, the repo also includes `docker-compose.local.yml`, which adds a small gateway service and the local frontend build arg. The visible `make front-docker` and `make test-e2e-docker` commands use that local overlay automatically.

### Recommended production routing

Use one public origin and route by path:

- `/api/*` -> backend
- `/ws` -> backend
- everything else -> frontend

This keeps the production app same-origin, so cookie auth and websocket auth stay simple.

In `tlfpaas`, the platform does this routing for you by looking at `tlfpaas.route` labels in the base `docker-compose.yml`.

If nginx or Traefik is on the same Docker network, it can route to:

- `frontend:8080`
- `backend:8081`

### Route roles for other app shapes

- Fullstack app: use `frontend` plus `backend`
- Single-service web app: one service with `tlfpaas.route=web`
- Backend-only public app: one service with `tlfpaas.route=backend`, serving only `/api` and `/ws`
- Worker or bot: no `tlfpaas.route` label
